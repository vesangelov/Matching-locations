# Matching-locations

3. Matching Locations
Write a program that reads names of places and their geographical coordinates in the format
name,latitude,longitude (where latitude and longitude are floating-point numbers). No two locations will
have the same name. Some locations may have the same coordinates.
After all locations are entered, a single line containing the '.' (dot) character will be entered.
After that, queries will be entered â€“ the queries will either contain a name of a location, or latitude and
longitude coordinates (entered as two floating point numbers separated by a single space). Print all locations that
match the query in the same format that they were entered.
After all queries are entered, a single line containing the '.' (dot) character will be entered.
